# JDBC
The project began by setting up a JDBC boilerplate, establishing a foundation for connecting to a database using Java. After the initial setup, the focus shifted to implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Statement objects in JDBC, allowing for direct interaction with the database.

To improve security and efficiency, the next step involved performing the same CRUD operations using PreparedStatement, which prevents SQL injection and optimizes query execution.

Building on this understanding, user input was incorporated to dynamically interact with the database, enhancing the practical utility of the operations.

The project then advanced to batch processing, enabling the execution of multiple SQL statements as a batch for better performance in scenarios involving bulk updates or inserts.

Finally, transaction handling was implemented to ensure data consistency and integrity by using commit and rollback mechanisms, especially in cases of complex, interdependent operations. This progression provided a comprehensive learning experience in JDBC, covering essential database interaction techniques.
